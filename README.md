 ## Overview of Election Audit

We read a .csv file of election data and pulled who the candidates were, what percentage and how many votes each candidate got and consequently determined who won the election. Also the analysis of the county to county breakdown was also done. Denver was the county with the highest number of votes. 

## Election Audit Summary

We we were able to determine that Diana Degette won with 73.8 of the vote and Denver was the county with the highest number of votes. This script can be used for any election given the .csv files with the election results is in the same format, with number of votes, county, and name in that order. If there is a different format, the script must be modified resepctively. Also, the sciprt can be modified to include items like voter demographics (gender, income, occupation, etc).
